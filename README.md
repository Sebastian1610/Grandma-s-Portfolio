Background: This past year, my grandmother suffered a stroke. Due to her infirm state, she is not able to handle day-to-day tasks and responsibilities she previously took care off. 
In addition to taking care of her, I wanted to create a safe, defensive –  in the Benjamin Graham sense - yielding portfolio, to help with her bills and expenses. 
My goal was – and continually is – to make sure her expenses are covered, so she can focus her full attention on recovering, and not worry about extraneous matters. 
Her funds will be earmarked for dividend-yielding Equities. Given her age and financial obligations, may focus will be placed on punctual distributions rather than capital appreciation, although the later will be welcomed.
