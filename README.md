Personal Portfolio Project

One of my favorite memories growing up, was reading the Wall Street Journal with my grandmother. We’d parse through the ticker section of our favorite stocks, always looking for Disney’s trading price the others of products we used, like Smuckers, Coke, and PepsiCo. I gradually realized that all of these companies (at the time: Disney), paid a dividend, which only augmented my interest in the Financial markets.   
Background: Unfortunately, this past year, my grandmother suffered a stroke. Due to her infirm state, she is not able to handle day-to-day tasks and responsibilities she previously took care off. 
In addition to taking care of her, I wanted to create a safe, defensive –  low beta - yielding portfolio, to help with her bills and expenses. 
My goal was – and continually is – to make sure her expenses are covered, so she can focus her full attention on recovering, and not worry about extraneous matters. 
Her funds will be earmarked for dividend-yielding Equities. Given her age and financial obligations, myt main focus will be placed on punctual distributions rather than capital appreciation, although the later will be welcomed. 

Case Study Goal: The main objective is to create a portfolio, that performs on par and/or better against a dividend yielding ETF and garners a higher yield, with a BETA lower than 1. 

Sub Goal: Given the monthly occurrence of bills, and how dividends are paid quarterly, I want to have a nonvarying monthly paying portfolio, where there is a constant flow of funds each month, and not a large sum paid every 4 months. To reach a consistent distribution, I will look into equities – more specifically REITs – that pay monthly dividends.
