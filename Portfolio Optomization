## - auto.assign = FALSE - allow you to put downloaded data in Global Environment, pertains to your environment

## - you are taking the 4th column in the data, and your combining it into your portfolioPrices object

portfolioPrices <- NULL

## na.omit to remove non-avaiable Values. IIPR price data does not go back 5 years, as company was still private. 

portPrice<- na.omit(ROC(portfolioPrices))

## The portfolio object is created with portfolio.spec. 
The portfolio object is an S3 object of class 'portfolio' used to hold the initial asset weights, constraints, objectives, 
and other information about the portfolio. The only required argument to portfolio.spec is assets.


portF <- portfolio.spec(colnames(portPrice))

## Add Constraints

portF <- add.constraint(portF, type = "full_investment")

portF <- add.constraint(portF, type = "box",  min = .10, max = .40)

## Add Objectives

portF <- add.objective(portF, type="risk", name="StdDev")

portF <- add.objective(portfolio = portF, type = "return", name = "mean")

## Optimize

optimizedPortfolio <- optimize.portfolio(R = portPrice, portfolio = portF, optimize_method = "ROI", trace = TRUE)


## Chart Portfolio Weights

chart.Weights(optimizedPortfolio)

## Efficient Frontier - is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. 
Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they do not provide enough return for the level of risk.

EF <- extractEfficientFrontier(optimizedPortfolio, match.col = "StdDev", n.portfolios = 25, risk_aversion = NULL)

chart.EfficientFrontier(EF,
                        match.col = "StdDev", n.portfolios = 25, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL,
